          Lyndon B. Johnson was born in Texas on August 27, 1908. He became the 36th President of the United States of America on November 22, 1963, after John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Johnson was appointed because of his then-current position of Vice President under Kennedy. He would finish Kennedy's term as President, and would be re-elected in 1964. Until his retirement in 1968, Johnson's administration dealt with severely contentious issues, namely the Civil Rights movement and the war in Vietnam. A new Civil Rights act was passed early in his presidency, motivating his plea for the nation to orient itself as a "Great Society", wherein "the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor". He aimed to improve education, healthcare, poverty, and civil rights, and was successful in executing social, economic, and scientific improvements while in office. He had publically supported the Vietnam War at the beginning of his time in office, but seized his opportunity to instigate negotiations by reducing the frequency of attacks on the Communist North and leaving office in 1968 to pursue peace as a private individual. He died on January 22nd, 1973, before the war in Vietnam had come to a conclusion.
